# 1. Histroy of C Programming Language

 - "C" is an Computer Programming language which was developed at At & t bell Laboratories by Dennis Ritchie in 1972.
 - Before "C" Programming Language,There are many Programming Language are available scuh as ALGOL,BCPL,B.
 - Most Part of Popular Operating System "Unix" was Written in C.

 | Time | Language | Other |
 | ----- | ----- | ------ |
 | 1960 | ALGOL | Internation Group |
 | 1967 | BCPL | Martin Richards |
 | 1970 | B | Ken Thompson |
 | 1972 | Traditional C | Dennis Ritchie |
 | 1978 | K & Rc | Kernighan & Ritchie |
 | 1989 | ANSIC | ANSI Committee |
 | 1990 | ANSI/ISO C | ISO Committee|
 | 1999 | C99 | Standarzation Committee|

- If C99 is the Improved Version of C,still many Available compilers do not support all the Features introduced.
- C is mostly designed for system Programming.
- It is Also used in Operating system,Utility Programmes,Compilers etc.

# 2. Features and Applications of C Programming language

## Features of C Language
- Middle level Language
- Modularity
- Portability
- Powerful
- Bit Manipulation

## Applications of C Programmes
- It is Used for Creating the application softwares.
- It is Used for Writing the System Softwares.
- It is used for writing the Embeded code for all electronic devices.
- It is also used for writing the simulators for various softwares & Hardware Products.

# 3. Structure of a Basic C Program
1. Documentation Section/Comment Section
2. Link Section
3. Global Declaration Section
4. Main() Section
5. Subprogram Section

````C
/*Basic C Program */
#incluse<stdio.h>
#incluse<conil.h>

void main()
{
  printf("Hello World");
  getch();
}
````
- The Documentation section deals with the Comment line,which used to write the Comment line,which used to write the purpose of the Program or coad.
- The Link Section deals with an instruction given to compiler to link functions from system library to program.
- The Global Declaration section,where we declare Global Variables which could be accessed by any function.
- The main() section,every C program contains one main function,This contains declaration section and executable part.every c statement end with semicolon.
- The Subprogram section contains all the user defined function denination that are called from main function.
